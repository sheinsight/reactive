> ⚛️ Reactive is a state management library for JavaScript applications, offering many features that make it both easy to use and powerful.

- **🧩 Flexible**: Want to change store state? Just [mutate](/reference/api#mutate) it anywhere you want.
- **😊 User-Friendly**: Cover over 80% of the use cases with [create](/reference/api#create) method.
- **⚡️ Optimized Performance**: Leverages [Proxy API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) to provide the best performance.
- **🏄 Unopinionated**: Works well both in [React](https://react.dev/) and Vanilla JS.
- **🦄 TypeScript**: Written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), fully typed, better DX.
- **🛠️ DevTools Integration**: Out-of-the-box [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools#redux-devtools) compatibility.
